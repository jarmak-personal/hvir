# Third-party notices

hvir includes and redistributes third-party software. Bundled npm dependencies retain
their own license files; this document additionally preserves the notices for the terminal
runtime that hvir modifies and redistributes. The names below identify the upstream
components only; hvir is not affiliated with or endorsed by their authors.

## ghostty-web

Source: <https://github.com/coder/ghostty-web>

hvir applies local modifications to ghostty-web through its
[checked-in patch](https://github.com/jarmak-personal/hvir/blob/main/patches/ghostty-web%2B0.4.0.patch).
Those modifications implement demand-driven rendering and terminal presentation lifecycle
controls for hvir. They are maintained by hvir contributors, not by Coder or the Ghostty
project.
