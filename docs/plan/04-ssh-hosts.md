# Phase 4 — SSH hosts

**Read first:** [`00-overview.md`](00-overview.md); design.md ADR-010 (this phase
implements it), ADR-005/006 (why git and PTYs are already transport-agnostic), §9 open
questions (dtach/abduco, remote watch strategy).

## Goal

`SshHost` as a second `ProjectHost`: projects on remote machines browse, view, save,
diff, and run terminals exactly like local ones. If Phase 1's seams held, **no renderer
code changes in this phase** — it's all behind the interface. A mixed set of local and
remote projects is the normal case, not a mode.

**Current status:** the transport, registry, queued auth UI, project picker, race-safe
bounded reconnect lifecycle, shared SFTP channel, portable watch fallback, cache, PTY path,
and hardened remote-Git broker are implemented. Automated tests cover config merging,
modern encrypted-key prompting, changed-key handling, connect/dispose races, UTF-8 stream
boundaries, SFTP reuse, broker confinement, and the shared local confinement behavior. The
acceptance checklist remains open until it is exercised
against a real configured SSH host, including a network drop and interactive TUI.

**Hands-on evidence (2026-07-13):** password authentication, remote browsing, terminal
commands, Git status/blame, and a 400+ commit history loaded cleanly on a real Linux host.
The same pass found two remaining acceptance blockers: a top-level directory plus 50 files
created by Codex did not invalidate the Files tree, and Codex's remote TUI flashed partial
working frames while ordinary typed input became visually hidden. Parent-listing cache
invalidation alone did not fix the tree on retest, so inotify now has an independent SFTP
snapshot watchdog and polling removals invalidate their parent listing. The first terminal
frame timer increased the flashing rate; it has been replaced with a chunk-boundary-safe DEC
synchronized-output buffer based on the mature Warp implementation. A second real-host retest
showed that an arbitrary terminal resize reliably clears both Codex defects, while the tree
still stayed stale. Complete synchronized frames now force the same full Ghostty repaint
without changing geometry, and a two-second cache-invalidating refresh pulse is independent of
the potentially long recursive SFTP snapshot. Both need another real-host retest. Network-drop,
passphrase-key, and keyboard-interactive/2FA scenarios were not exercised.

**UX amendment (2026-07-12):** remote work is a session flow, not a host/path form. The
user first chooses and connects to an SSH alias, then opens a folder on that connected
host; afterward hvir behaves exactly like a local session while continuously showing a
quiet remote-context indicator. The redesign is tracked in
[`03-05-review-followups.md`](03-05-review-followups.md) and must land before Phase 4
acceptance.

## Tasks

### Connection layer
- [x] `SshHost` on the `ssh2` npm package: one multiplexed client per host config,
      exec channels for `exec`/`spawnPty` (pty: true), SFTP for
      `readFile`/`writeFile`/`readdir`/`stat`.
- [x] Host config: parse `~/.ssh/config` for Host aliases, hostname, user, port,
      IdentityFile (verify a maintained parser package vs hand-rolling the subset).
      A host in hvir is referenced by its alias.
- [x] Auth ladder: ssh-agent first, then identity files, then interactive prompts
      (passphrase / password / keyboard-interactive for 2FA) surfaced through a proper
      renderer dialog — never silently hang.
- [x] Keepalives + reconnect with backoff. Connection state (connected / reconnecting /
      failed) exposed as events; renderer shows it on the project.

### Behavior on top
- [x] Enforce registered-root confinement after canonicalization for every remote
      filesystem operation and PTY cwd. Resolve symlinks (including parent components)
      before authorization so a project-internal link cannot escape the root; define
      and test the equivalent local behavior at the same trust boundary.
- [x] Remote PTYs through the supervisor: `spawnPty` runs the command in an exec
      channel with a PTY; resize propagates; `HarnessAdapter` commands compose (the
      supervisor runs `claude ...` on the host — the adapter doesn't know it's remote).
- [x] Remote git: confirm the Phase 3 git slice works unchanged through
      `SshHost.exec` (it should — fix seam leaks if not).
- [x] `watch` implementation, tiered (ADR-010): **polling** of open-tab files and git
      status as the baseline; capability-detect `inotifywait` at connect time and
      stream `inotifywait -rm` over an exec channel where available. Record which tier
      a host got.
- [x] Read caching for tree listings and file reads with watch/poll invalidation, so
      latency degrades freshness, never responsiveness (§3.2).

### UX
- [x] Session flow: choose a local/SSH host, connect and authenticate first, then browse or
      enter a folder on that host using the shared lazy directory tree. Keep the active
      host/root and connection state visible.
- [x] Explicit disconnect/reconnect lifecycle: stop watches and PTYs, close the transport,
      retain stale tabs, disconnect the replaced host on session switches, and gracefully
      close every SSH client before app quit.
- [x] Disconnected project state: tabs show cached content marked stale; terminals show
      exited; reconnect restores and (Phase 6+) offers session resume.
- [ ] Investigate remote-session survivability across SSH drops: prototype wrapping
      remote harness PTYs in `dtach` or `abduco` (transparent, no rendering layer —
      unlike tmux). Record the outcome as an ADR or an updated open question. Stretch —
      do not block the phase on it.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] A project on a remote host: tree browses, files open in all view modes, save
      works, diff vs HEAD works — through unchanged renderer code.
- [ ] `claude` (or any TUI) runs in a remote terminal pane and feels responsive.
- [ ] Kill the network mid-session: UI stays responsive, project shows disconnected,
      reconnect recovers browsing and terminals without an app restart.
- [ ] Auth: key-with-passphrase and 2FA-style keyboard-interactive both prompt in-app
      and succeed.
- [ ] Editing a remote file externally is reflected in an open tab within the polling
      interval.
- [x] Status table updated.

## Non-goals
Remote worktree discovery UI (Phase 7 — but it must work through `ProjectHost`, which
this phase guarantees). Jump hosts / ProxyJump, port forwarding, SFTP file-manager
features. A persistent installed remote agent — rejected in ADR-010, hold the line.
